I am a master's student in the School of Control and Computer Engineering at North China Electric Power University, pursuing my master's degree in Computer Science. I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering in 2023 and my research on fuzzy control was awarded the title of **Excellent Graduation Thesis**. 

Prior to this, I was interested in embedded real-time operating systems and efficient switch-mode power supply control. I have won several competition awards, for example, the four-switch buck-boost circuit I designed won **1st Prize in the 2020 electronic design competition sponsored by Huawei**. In 2022, the multi-vehicle system I developed earned **the highest honor, the “TI Cup,”** in the electronic design competition sponsored by Texas Instruments.

Currently, I am conducting research under the supervision of [Prof. Long Cheng](https://longcheng.eu/) in the [Distributed Systems Group](http://distsys.org.cn/) he leads. My research focuses on the **optimization of computing and decision-making in intelligent transportation systems**. Additionally, I have also carried out some work in **quantum computing**.
