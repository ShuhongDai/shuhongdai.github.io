The goal was straightforward: load a task from the DeepMind Control Suite and render frames for a CNN-based policy. However, running dm-control without a graphical display consistently triggered a series of rendering failures.</p> <p>Rather than providing a tutorial, this article records the issues encountered, the different directions explored, and the final configuration that proved reliable. Hopefully, this log will help anyone attempting to run dm-control in a similar environment.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="initial-attempts-and-rendering-errors">Initial Attempts and Rendering Errors</h2> <p>The starting point was simply loading a task and calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">env.physics.render()</code>. On a local machine, this works immediately. On a headless server, the first result was an error referencing <strong>EGL</strong> and <strong>OpenGL</strong>:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'eglQueryString'

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Further attempts produced warnings about missing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DISPLAY</code> variables:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
X11: The DISPLAY environment variable is missing

</code></pre></div></div> <p>These messages made it clear that dm-control was attempting to initialize rendering through OpenGL/EGL, both of which require a graphics context the server did not provide. Disabling the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DISPLAY</code> variable or forcing EGL did not resolve the issue; the underlying environment simply lacked the dependencies required for hardware-accelerated rendering.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="investigating-the-role-of-pyopengl">Investigating the Role of PyOpenGL</h2> <p>The repeated mentions of EGL led to checking whether PyOpenGL played a role. Removing PyOpenGL temporarily modified the error messages, but it was automatically reinstalled when upgrading or reinstalling dm-control and Mujoco. This indicated that avoiding the OpenGL backend entirely was not feasible through uninstalling PyOpenGL alone.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="version-mismatch-between-dm-control-and-mujoco">Version Mismatch Between dm-control and Mujoco</h2> <p>At a later stage, entirely different errors appeared:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
eq_active not found
flex_xvert0 not found

</code></pre></div></div> <p>These errors are characteristic of <strong>Mujoco internal structure mismatches</strong>, suggesting that the installed versions of Mujoco and dm-control were not aligned. dm-control indexes Mujoco model structures by field name, and when they do not match, initialization fails even before rendering begins.</p> <p>This confirmed that two separate issues existed:</p> <ol> <li>Rendering backend not compatible with the server</li> <li>dm-control and Mujoco versions not compatible with each other</li> </ol> <p>Both needed to be addressed.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="moving-toward-a-software-rendering-approach">Moving Toward a Software Rendering Approach</h2> <p>Given that neither EGL nor OpenGL would work reliably on the server, the next candidate was <strong>OSMesa</strong>, a pure software renderer. OSMesa performs all rendering on the CPU and does not require a graphical display or GPU drivers. This makes it suitable for cloud or containerized environments.</p> <p>Ubuntu provides OSMesa through:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
libosmesa6-dev

</code></pre></div></div> <p>The key environment variable for Mujoco is:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
MUJOCO_GL=osmesa

</code></pre></div></div> <p>With this backend, Mujoco no longer attempts to initialize hardware-accelerated contexts.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="identifying-a-stable-mujoco--dm-control-combination">Identifying a Stable Mujoco + dm-control Combination</h2> <p>After testing multiple combinations, the following versions proved to be both compatible with each other and functional under OSMesa:</p> <ul> <li><strong>mujoco 2.3.3</strong></li> <li><strong>dm-control 1.0.11</strong></li> <li>Python 3.9</li> </ul> <p>This combination avoids the structure-indexing errors seen in newer pairings and also avoids invoking backends requiring OpenGL or EGL by default.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="verifying-the-configuration">Verifying the Configuration</h2> <p>With OSMesa enabled and the compatible versions installed, the following minimal script successfully produced a rendered frame:</p> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">os</span>

Many people interpret this as “network censorship,” but in my view the situation is more nuanced. It is not necessarily the result of direct, targeted enforcement against technical resources. Instead, it resembles a systemic consequence of long-term authoritarian governance, where private network operators behave with extreme caution in order to avoid any possible regulatory risk.</p> <p>Under such an environment—opaque rules, inconsistent enforcement, and heavy potential penalties—service providers tend to implement their own overly strict filtering. As a result, traffic to platforms like HuggingFace, GitHub, PyPI, and other purely technical services may be blocked or reset “just in case.” In practice, it becomes a case of <em>tying themselves up with their own rope</em>.</p> <p>For developers and researchers, this means that even a cloud server intended for normal machine learning tasks may have difficulty accessing essential foreign resources. This post documents the issues I encountered and the final working solution.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="attempt-1-running-a-proxy-directly-on-the-server">Attempt 1: Running a Proxy Directly on the Server</h2> <p>My first attempt was to deploy a proxy environment directly on the cloud server using sing-box or Xray, and to reuse my existing Shadowsocks 2022 (SS2022) nodes from my Windows machine.</p> <p>This approach ran into multiple problems:</p> <ul> <li>Different implementations of SS2022 use different field names</li> <li>The key format (base64) requirements vary by version</li> <li>Certain fields (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">secondary</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">psk</code>) are not supported in older releases</li> <li>Some configurations pass syntax checks but fail during actual traffic forwarding</li> <li>sing-box support for SS2022 differs significantly among releases</li> </ul> <p>Even after repeated adjustments, the connection remained unstable or unusable.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="attempt-2-letting-the-server-reuse-my-local-v2rayn-proxy-successful">Attempt 2: Letting the Server Reuse My Local v2rayN Proxy (Successful)</h2> <p>Since my local Windows environment with v2rayN worked reliably, I attempted to make the cloud server reuse <strong>my desktop’s proxy</strong> via <strong>SSH reverse port forwarding</strong>.</p> <p>I established an SSH session from the cloud server:</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ssh <span class="nt">-o</span> <span class="nv">ServerAliveInterval</span><span class="o">=</span>60 <span class="se">\</span>
    <span class="nt">-o</span> <span class="nv">ServerAliveCountMax</span><span class="o">=</span>3 <span class="se">\</span>
    <span class="nt">-R</span> 0.0.0.0:10808:127.0.0.1:10808 <span class="se">\</span>
    root@&lt;server-address&gt;
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This command:</p> <ul> <li>Opens <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10808</code> on the cloud server</li> <li>Forwards all traffic from that port</li> <li>Back through the SSH tunnel to my Windows machine</li> <li>Where v2rayN listens on local port <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10808</code></li> </ul> <p>Testing the proxy:</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>curl <span class="nt">--socks5</span> 127.0.0.1:10808 https://ipinfo.io/ip
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The returned IP was exactly the exit node of my v2rayN setup, confirming that the cloud server was successfully using my local proxy.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="python-configuration">Python Configuration</h2> <p>Once <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl</code> worked, I needed Python (especially <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">requests</code> and HuggingFace Hub) to use SOCKS5.</p> <p>Python does not support SOCKS by default, so I installed:</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip <span class="nb">install </span>pysocks
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Then set the environment variables:</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">http_proxy</span><span class="o">=</span>socks5h://127.0.0.1:10808
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">https_proxy</span><span class="o">=</span>socks5h://127.0.0.1:10808
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">all_proxy</span><span class="o">=</span>socks5h://127.0.0.1:10808
</code></pre></div></div> <p>After this, both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">requests.get()</code> and HuggingFace model downloads worked correctly.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2> <p>It is important to note that deploying a proxy service directly on the server is not only feasible but is, in fact, the more standard, professional, and long-term maintainable approach. Whether using sing-box, Xray, Hysteria, or Tuic, one can build a fully independent outbound capability on the cloud server, which aligns better with the engineering practice of “managing your own network boundary.”</p> <p>However, this approach typically involves multiple layers of complexity: protocol specifications, key formats, server–client version compatibility, differences in supported cipher suites, and firewall behavior. This is especially true for SS2022, which lacks unified documentation and consistent implementation across projects. As a result, several subtle issues may arise during configuration and require careful troubleshooting.</p> <p>In contrast, reusing a local proxy through SSH reverse port forwarding serves as a fast, low-overhead, and almost configuration-free alternative. Its main advantage is that it works immediately and is not affected by the cloud provider’s network policies. The drawback, of course, is that it depends on the local machine being online, making it unsuitable as a long-term infrastructure solution.</p> <p>Based on this distinction: for time-sensitive situations, such as urgently needing to download model weights from HuggingFace, reusing a local proxy is extremely convenient. But for long-term project environments, if the goal is to maintain an autonomous and stable outbound capability on the server, deploying a proper proxy service on the server remains the recommended final solution.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Networking"/><category term="Proxy"/><category term="SSH"/><category term="DevOps"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A practical record of troubleshooting outbound network restrictions on Chinese cloud servers and enabling stable access to foreign academic resources.]]></summary></entry></feed>
