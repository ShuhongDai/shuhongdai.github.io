## Given Conditions
A *vector space* (over the reals) is a set $V$ together with two binary operations which we call addition (+) and scalar multiplication (·). The addition operation is a function which takes two elements of $V$, say $v$ and $w$, and returns a third element of $V$, which we write as $v+w$, while scalar multiplication is a function which takes a real number and an element of $V$,say $s$ and $v$, and returms another element of $V$,which we write as $s\cdot v.$ The operations are called“binary”because they take two arguments. The two operations must satisfy the following properties:

- Addition operation is commutative: $v+w=w+v$ for all $w$ and $v.$
- There exists an additive identity element, which we write as $\vec{0}$ such that $\vec{0}+w=w$ for all $w.$
- Scalar multiplication distributes over addition in $V{:}s\cdot(v+w)=s\cdot v+s\cdot w.$
- Scalar multiplication distributes over addition in $\mathbb{R}{:}$ if $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ and $w\in V$, then $(a+b)\cdot w=a\cdot w+b\cdot w$, where in the left hand side of the equation the addition is the familiar addition operation in $\mathbb{R}$, but on the right hand side the addition is the addition operation in $V$.
-  Associativity of addition: $(v+w)+z=v+(w+z).$
- Compatibility of scalar multiplication with real-number multiplication: if $s$ and $c$ are real numbers and $v\in V$,then $(sc)\cdot v=s\cdot(c\cdot v).$
- $1\cdot v= v$ for all $v\in V.$
- Every element $v\in V$ has an *additive inverse* $w$ such that $v+w=\vec{0}.$

## (a) Let $V=\mathbb{R}$ and let the addition and multiplication operations be the standard addition and multiplication in $\mathbb{R}$. Show that $V$ is a vector space. 

*Proof.* To establish that $V$ is a vector space over the field $\mathbb{R}$, it suffices to verify that the eight vector space axioms are satisfied.
Axiom 1: Commutativity of Addition

$$
\forall u, v \in V, \quad u + v = v + u.
$$

Verification: The standard addition of real numbers is commutative; hence, for any $u, v \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$
u + v = v + u.
$$

Thus, Axiom 1 holds.

Axiom 2: Associativity of Addition

$$
\forall u, v, w \in V, \quad (u + v) + w = u + (v + w).
$$

Verification: The standard addition of real numbers is associative; therefore, for any $u, v, w \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$
(u + v) + w = u + (v + w).
$$

Thus, Axiom 2 is satisfied.

Axiom 3: Existence of Additive Identity

$$
\exists \tilde{0} \in V \text{ such that } \forall v \in V, \quad \tilde{0} + v = v.
$$

Verification: In $\mathbb{R}$, the additive identity is $0$. For any $v \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$
0 + v = v.
$$

Hence, $\tilde{0} = 0$ serves as the additive identity, satisfying Axiom 3.

Axiom 4: Existence of Additive Inverses

$$
\forall v \in V, \exists w \in V \text{ such that } v + w = \tilde{0}.
$$

Verification: For any $v \in \mathbb{R}$, the additive inverse is $-v$. Thus,

$$
v + (-v) = 0 = \tilde{0}.
$$

Therefore, every element $v$ in $V$ has an additive inverse $-v$, satisfying Axiom 4.

Axiom 5: Scalar Multiplication Distributes over Vector Addition

$$
\forall s \in \mathbb{R}, \forall u, v \in V, \quad s \cdot (u + v) = s \cdot u + s \cdot v.
$$

Verification: The distributive property of real numbers ensures that for any $s, u, v \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$
s \cdot (u + v) = s \cdot u + s \cdot v.
$$

Thus, Axiom 5 is satisfied.

Axiom 6: Scalar Addition Distributes over Scalar Multiplication

$$
\forall a, b \in \mathbb{R}, \forall v \in V, \quad (a + b) \cdot v = a \cdot v + b \cdot v.
$$

Verification: The distributive property of real numbers implies that for any $a, b, v \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$
(a + b) \cdot v = a \cdot v + b \cdot v.
$$

Therefore, Axiom 6 holds.

Axiom 7: Compatibility of Scalar Multiplication with Field Multiplication

$$
\forall s, c \in \mathbb{R}, \forall v \in V, \quad (s \cdot c) \cdot v = s \cdot (c \cdot v).
$$

Verification: The associativity of multiplication in $\mathbb{R}$ ensures that for any $s, c, v \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$
(s \cdot c) \cdot v = s \cdot (c \cdot v).
$$

Hence, Axiom 7 is satisfied.

Axiom 8: Scalar Multiplicative Identity

$$
\forall v \in V, \quad 1 \cdot v = v.
$$

Verification: In $\mathbb{R}$, the multiplicative identity is $1$. For any $v \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$
1 \cdot v = v.
$$

Thus, Axiom 8 holds.

Having verified all eight vector space axioms, $V = \mathbb{R}$ with standard addition and scalar multiplication is a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$.
