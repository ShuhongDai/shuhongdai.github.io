## Given Conditions
A *vector space* (over the reals) is a set $V$ together with two binary operations which we call addition (+) and scalar multiplication (·). The addition operation is a function which takes two elements of $V$, say $v$ and $w$, and returns a third element of $V$, which we write as $v+w$, while scalar multiplication is a function which takes a real number and an element of $V$,say $s$ and $v$, and returms another element of $V$,which we write as $s\cdot v.$ The operations are called“binary”because they take two arguments. The two operations must satisfy the following properties:

- Addition operation is commutative: $v+w=w+v$ for all $w$ and $v.$
- There exists an additive identity element, which we write as $\vec{0}$ such that $\vec{0}+w=w$ for all $w.$
- Scalar multiplication distributes over addition in $V{:}s\cdot(v+w)=s\cdot v+s\cdot w.$
- Scalar multiplication distributes over addition in $\mathbb{R}{:}$ if $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ and $w\in V$, then $(a+b)\cdot w=a\cdot w+b\cdot w$, where in the left hand side of the equation the addition is the familiar addition operation in $\mathbb{R}$, but on the right hand side the addition is the addition operation in $V$.
-  Associativity of addition: $(v+w)+z=v+(w+z).$
- Compatibility of scalar multiplication with real-number multiplication: if $s$ and $c$ are real numbers and $v\in V$,then $(sc)\cdot v=s\cdot(c\cdot v).$
- $1\cdot v= v$ for all $v\in V.$
- Every element $v\in V$ has an *additive inverse* $w$ such that $v+w=\vec{0}.$

---

## (a) Let $V=\mathbb{R}$ and let the addition and multiplication operations be the standard addition and multiplication in $\mathbb{R}$. Show that $V$ is a vector space. 

*Proof.* To establish that $V$ is a vector space over the field $\mathbb{R}$, it suffices to verify that the eight vector space axioms are satisfied.
Axiom 1: Commutativity of Addition

$$
\forall u, v \in V, \quad u + v = v + u.
$$

Verification: The standard addition of real numbers is commutative; hence, for any $u, v \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$
u + v = v + u.
$$

Thus, Axiom 1 holds.

Axiom 2: Associativity of Addition

$$
\forall u, v, w \in V, \quad (u + v) + w = u + (v + w).
$$

Verification: The standard addition of real numbers is associative; therefore, for any $u, v, w \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$
(u + v) + w = u + (v + w).
$$

Thus, Axiom 2 is satisfied.

Axiom 3: Existence of Additive Identity

$$
\exists \tilde{0} \in V \text{ such that } \forall v \in V, \quad \tilde{0} + v = v.
$$

Verification: In $\mathbb{R}$, the additive identity is $0$. For any $v \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$
0 + v = v.
$$

Hence, $\tilde{0} = 0$ serves as the additive identity, satisfying Axiom 3.

Axiom 4: Existence of Additive Inverses

$$
\forall v \in V, \exists w \in V \text{ such that } v + w = \tilde{0}.
$$

Verification: For any $v \in \mathbb{R}$, the additive inverse is $-v$. Thus,

$$
v + (-v) = 0 = \tilde{0}.
$$

Therefore, every element $v$ in $V$ has an additive inverse $-v$, satisfying Axiom 4.

Axiom 5: Scalar Multiplication Distributes over Vector Addition

$$
\forall s \in \mathbb{R}, \forall u, v \in V, \quad s \cdot (u + v) = s \cdot u + s \cdot v.
$$

Verification: The distributive property of real numbers ensures that for any $s, u, v \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$
s \cdot (u + v) = s \cdot u + s \cdot v.
$$

Thus, Axiom 5 is satisfied.

Axiom 6: Scalar Addition Distributes over Scalar Multiplication

$$
\forall a, b \in \mathbb{R}, \forall v \in V, \quad (a + b) \cdot v = a \cdot v + b \cdot v.
$$

Verification: The distributive property of real numbers implies that for any $a, b, v \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$
(a + b) \cdot v = a \cdot v + b \cdot v.
$$

Therefore, Axiom 6 holds.

Axiom 7: Compatibility of Scalar Multiplication with Field Multiplication

$$
\forall s, c \in \mathbb{R}, \forall v \in V, \quad (s \cdot c) \cdot v = s \cdot (c \cdot v).
$$

Verification: The associativity of multiplication in $\mathbb{R}$ ensures that for any $s, c, v \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$
(s \cdot c) \cdot v = s \cdot (c \cdot v).
$$

Hence, Axiom 7 is satisfied.

Axiom 8: Scalar Multiplicative Identity

$$
\forall v \in V, \quad 1 \cdot v = v.
$$

Verification: In $\mathbb{R}$, the multiplicative identity is $1$. For any $v \in \mathbb{R}$,

$$
1 \cdot v = v.
$$

Thus, Axiom 8 holds.

Having verified all eight vector space axioms, $V = \mathbb{R}$ with standard addition and scalar multiplication is a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$. $\textbf{Q.E.D.}$

## (b) Let $X$ be some arbitrary space and let $F$ be the set of functions $f:X\to\mathbb{R}.$ Given any two functions $f$ and $g$, we can define their sum $k:=f+g$ as the function $k(x)=f(x)+g(x).$ Further, given a scalar $s$ and a function $f$, we define the scalar multiplication $k:=s\cdot f$ as the function $k(x)=s\times f(x)$, where $\times$ indicates standard multiplication of real numbers. Show that $F$ with these addition and scalar multiplication operators is a vector space.
  
*Proof.* Let $X$ be an arbitrary set, and let $F$ denote the set of all functions from $X$ to $\mathbb{R}$, i.e., $F =$ { $f \mid f: X \to \mathbb{R}$ }. Define the operations of addition and scalar multiplication on $F$ as follows:

$$
\forall f, g \in F, \quad (f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) \quad \text{for all } x \in X,
$$

$$
\forall s \in \mathbb{R}, \forall f \in F, \quad (s \cdot f)(x) = s \cdot f(x) \quad \text{for all } x \in X.
$$

To establish that $F$ is a vector space over the field $\mathbb{R}$, it is requisite to verify that the eight axioms defining a vector space are satisfied under the aforementioned operations.

Axiom 1: Commutativity of Addition

$$
\forall f, g \in F, \quad f + g = g + f.
$$

Verification: For any $f, g \in F$ and for all $x \in X$,

$$
(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) = g(x) + f(x) = (g + f)(x).
$$

Since this equality holds for all $x \in X$, it follows that $f + g = g + f$. Hence, addition is commutative.

Axiom 2: Associativity of Addition

$$
\forall f, g, h \in F, \quad (f + g) + h = f + (g + h).
$$

Verification: For any $f, g, h \in F$ and for all $x \in X$,

$$
((f + g) + h)(x) = (f + g)(x) + h(x) = (f(x) + g(x)) + h(x),
$$

$$
(f + (g + h))(x) = f(x) + (g + h)(x) = f(x) + (g(x) + h(x)).
$$

By the associativity of real number addition,

$$
(f(x) + g(x)) + h(x) = f(x) + (g(x) + h(x)),
$$

which implies

$$
((f + g) + h)(x) = (f + (g + h))(x).
$$

Since this holds for all $x \in X$, it follows that $(f + g) + h = f + (g + h)$. Hence, addition is associative.

Axiom 3: Existence of Additive Identity

$$
\exists \tilde{0} \in F \text{ such that } \forall f \in F, \quad \tilde{0} + f = f.
$$

Verification: Define $\tilde{0}$ as the zero function, i.e., $\tilde{0}(x) = 0$ for all $x \in X$. For any $f \in F$ and for all $x \in X$,

$$
(\tilde{0} + f)(x) = \tilde{0}(x) + f(x) = 0 + f(x) = f(x).
$$

Thus, $\tilde{0} + f = f$ for all $f \in F$, establishing the existence of an additive identity in $F$.

Axiom 4: Existence of Additive Inverses

$$
\forall f \in F, \exists g \in F \text{ such that } f + g = \tilde{0}.
$$

Verification: For any $f \in F$, define $g = -f$, where $(-f)(x) = -f(x)$ for all $x \in X$. Then, for all $x \in X$,

$$
(f + g)(x) = f(x) + (-f(x)) = 0 = \tilde{0}(x).
$$

Therefore, $f + g = \tilde{0}$, confirming the existence of an additive inverse for every element in $F$.

Axiom 5: Scalar Multiplication Distributes over Vector Addition

$$
\forall s \in \mathbb{R}, \forall f, g \in F, \quad s \cdot (f + g) = s \cdot f + s \cdot g.
$$

Verification: For any $s \in \mathbb{R}$, $f, g \in F$, and for all $x \in X$,

$$
(s \cdot (f + g))(x) = s \cdot (f + g)(x) = s \cdot (f(x) + g(x)),
$$

$$
(s \cdot f + s \cdot g)(x) = (s \cdot f)(x) + (s \cdot g)(x) = s \cdot f(x) + s \cdot g(x).
$$

By the distributive property of real numbers,

$$
s \cdot (f(x) + g(x)) = s \cdot f(x) + s \cdot g(x),
$$

which implies

$$
(s \cdot (f + g))(x) = (s \cdot f + s \cdot g)(x).
$$

Since this holds for all $x \in X$, it follows that $s \cdot (f + g) = s \cdot f + s \cdot g$. Thus, scalar multiplication distributes over vector addition.

Axiom 6: Scalar Addition Distributes over Scalar Multiplication

$$
\forall a, b \in \mathbb{R}, \forall f \in F, \quad (a + b) \cdot f = a \cdot f + b \cdot f.
$$

Verification: For any $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$, $f \in F$, and for all $x \in X$,

$$
((a + b) \cdot f)(x) = (a + b) \cdot f(x),
$$

$$
(a \cdot f + b \cdot f)(x) = (a \cdot f)(x) + (b \cdot f)(x) = a \cdot f(x) + b \cdot f(x).
$$

By the distributive property of real numbers,

$$
(a + b) \cdot f(x) = a \cdot f(x) + b \cdot f(x),
$$

which implies

$$
((a + b) \cdot f)(x) = (a \cdot f + b \cdot f)(x).
$$

Since this equality holds for all $x \in X$, it follows that $(a + b) \cdot f = a \cdot f + b \cdot f$. Therefore, scalar addition distributes over scalar multiplication.

Axiom 7: Compatibility of Scalar Multiplication with Field Multiplication

$$
\forall a, b \in \mathbb{R}, \forall f \in F, \quad a \cdot (b \cdot f) = (a \cdot b) \cdot f.
$$

Verification: For any $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$, $f \in F$, and for all $x \in X$,

$$
(a \cdot (b \cdot f))(x) = a \cdot (b \cdot f)(x) = a \cdot (b \cdot f(x))
$$

$$
((a \cdot b) \cdot f)(x) = (a \cdot b) \cdot f(x).
$$

By the associative property of real number multiplication,

$$
a \cdot (b \cdot f(x)) = (a \cdot b) \cdot f(x),
$$

which implies

$$
(a \cdot (b \cdot f))(x) = ((a \cdot b) \cdot f)(x).
$$

Since this holds for all $x \in X$, it follows that $a \cdot (b \cdot f) = (a \cdot b) \cdot f$. Hence, scalar multiplication is compatible with field multiplication.

Axiom 8: Existence of Scalar Multiplicative Identity

$$
\forall f \in F, \quad 1 \cdot f = f.
$$

Verification: For any $f \in F$ and for all $x \in X$,

$$
(1 \cdot f)(x) = 1 \cdot f(x) = f(x).
$$

Therefore, $1 \cdot f = f$ for all $f \in F$, establishing the existence of a scalar multiplicative identity in $F$.

After verifying all eight axioms, we conclude that $F =$ { $f \mid f: X \to \mathbb{R}$ } with standard function addition and scalar multiplication forms a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$. $\textbf{Q.E.D.}$

## \(c\) Show that the additive identity is unique. Specifically, $i\in V$ is such that there exists some $w\in V$ such that $i+w=w$, then $i=\vec{0}$.

Let $V$ be a vector space over the field $\mathbb{R}$, equipped with the operations of vector addition $+$ and scalar multiplication $\cdot$. Denote by $\vec{0}$ the additive identity in $V$, satisfying

$$
\forall v \in V, \quad \vec{0} + v = v.
$$

**Theorem 1.c.1.** *In any vector space $V$ over $\mathbb{R}$, the additive identity is unique.*

*Proof.* Suppose $i \in V$ is an element such that there exists $w \in V$ with

$$
i + w = w.
$$

We aim to show that $i = \vec{0}$.

Consider the additive identity $\vec{0}$ in $V$, which satisfies

$$
\forall v \in V, \quad \vec{0} + v = v.
$$

In particular, for the vector $w \in V$, we have

$$
\vec{0} + w = w.
$$

Given that both $i$ and $\vec{0}$ satisfy the property of being additive identities with respect to the vector $w$, we have

$$
i + w = w \quad \text{and} \quad \vec{0} + w = w.
$$

Therefore, we can equate the two expressions:

$$
i + w = \vec{0} + w.
$$

By the associativity and cancellation properties of vector addition, we can deduce the following:

$$
i + w = \vec{0} + w \implies (i + w) = (\vec{0} + w).
$$

Subtracting $w$ from both sides, we obtain

$$
i = \vec{0}.
$$

$\textbf{Q.E.D.}$

> **Commentary** 
>
> The cancellation property in a vector space states that if $u + v = u + w$, then $v = w$. Applying this property to the equation $i + w = \vec{0} + w$, we cancel $w$ from both sides to conclude that $i = \vec{0}$.

---

## (d) Show that $\vec{0}$ satisfes $s\cdot\vec{0}=\vec{0}$ for all $s\in\mathbb{R}.$

Let $V$ be a vector space over the field $\mathbb{R}$, equipped with the operations of vector addition $+$ and scalar multiplication $\cdot$. Denote by $\vec{0}$ the additive identity in $V$, satisfying

$$
\forall v \in V, \quad \vec{0} + v = v.
$$

**Theorem 1.d.1.** *In any vector space $V$ over $\mathbb{R}$, the scalar multiplication of any real number $s$ with the additive identity $\vec{0}$ satisfies $s \cdot \vec{0} = \vec{0}$.*

*Proof.* Let $s \in \mathbb{R}$ be an arbitrary scalar. Consider the scalar multiplication $s \cdot \vec{0}$. We aim to show that $s \cdot \vec{0} = \vec{0}$.

By the distributive property of scalar multiplication over vector addition (Axiom 5), we have:

$$
s \cdot (\vec{0} + \vec{0}) = s \cdot \vec{0} + s \cdot \vec{0}.
$$

Since $\vec{0}$ is the additive identity, it satisfies:

$$
\vec{0} + \vec{0} = \vec{0}.
$$

Substituting this into the previous equation yields:

$$
s \cdot \vec{0} = s \cdot \vec{0} + s \cdot \vec{0}.
$$

Let $x = s \cdot \vec{0}$. Then the equation becomes:

$$
x = x + x.
$$

Subtracting $x$ from both sides (utilizing the existence of additive inverses, Axiom 4), we obtain:

$$
x - x = (x + x) - x.
$$

Simplifying both sides:

$$
\vec{0} = x.
$$

Thus,

$$
s \cdot \vec{0} = \vec{0}.
$$

Since $s \in \mathbb{R}$ was arbitrary, the equality holds for all real scalars $s$.  $\textbf{Q.E.D.}$

---

## (e) Show that $0\in\mathbb{R}$ satisfies $0\cdot w=\vec{0}$ for all $w\in V$.

Let $V$ be a vector space over the field $\mathbb{R}$, endowed with the operations of vector addition $+$ and scalar multiplication $\cdot$. Denote by $\vec{0}$ the additive identity in $V$, satisfying

$$
\forall v \in V, \quad \vec{0} + v = v.
$$

**Theorem 1.e.1.** *In any vector space $V$ over $\mathbb{R}$, the scalar zero acts as the additive identity under scalar multiplication; that is, for all $w \in V$, $0 \cdot w = \vec{0}$.*

*Proof.* Let $w \in V$ be arbitrary. Consider the scalar multiplication of $0$ with $w$:

$$
0 \cdot w.
$$

By the distributive property of scalar multiplication over scalar addition (Axiom 6), we have:

$$
(0 + 0) \cdot w = 0 \cdot w + 0 \cdot w.
$$

Calculating the left-hand side using the fact that $0 + 0 = 0$ in $\mathbb{R}$:

$$
0 \cdot w = 0 \cdot w + 0 \cdot w.
$$

Let $x = 0 \cdot w$. Substituting, we obtain:

$$
x = x + x.
$$

To isolate $x$, we subtract $x$ from both sides of the equation (utilizing the existence of additive inverses, Axiom 4):

$$
x - x = (x + x) - x.
$$

Simplifying both sides:

$$
\vec{0} = x.
$$

Thus,

$$
0 \cdot w = \vec{0}.
$$

Since $w \in V$ was arbitrary, the equality holds for all $w \in V$. $\textbf{Q.E.D.}$

>**Commentary**
>Through the application of the distributive property of scalar multiplication over scalar addition and the properties of additive inverses within the vector space $V$, it has been rigorously established that for the scalar zero $0 \in \mathbb{R}$ and for any vector $w \in V$, the scalar multiplication $0 \cdot w$ yields the additive identity $\vec{0}$. Therefore, $0 \cdot w = \vec{0}$ holds universally within the structure of the vector space $V$.

---

## (f) Suppose (just for this question) that the vector spaces need not have additive inverses, so that you cannot rely on that axiom when proving this statement. Show that nevertheless, if $i\in V$ is such that $i+w=w$ $\tilde{\text{for all }w}$,then $i=\vec{0}.$ Note that this is a weaker result than question \(c\) (why?).

> **Commentary**
>
> Let $V$ be a vector space over the field $\mathbb{R}$, endowed with the operations of vector addition $+$ and scalar multiplication $\cdot$. In this context, we consider a modification of the standard vector space axioms by omitting the requirement for the existence of additive inverses. Specifically, we investigate the uniqueness of the additive identity under this relaxed structure.

**Theorem 1.f.1.** *In a vector space $V$ over $\mathbb{R}$, where the existence of additive inverses is not assumed, if an element $i \in V$ satisfies $i + w = w$ for all $w \in V$, then $i$ coincides with the additive identity $\vec{0}$.*

*Proof.* Assume $V$ is a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ with the operations $+$ and $\cdot$ satisfying all vector space axioms except the existence of additive inverses. Let $\vec{0} \in V$ denote the additive identity, satisfying

$$
\forall w \in V, \quad \vec{0} + w = w.
$$

Suppose $i \in V$ is an element such that

$$
\forall w \in V, \quad i + w = w.
$$

We aim to demonstrate that $i = \vec{0}$.

Consider an arbitrary element $w \in V$. By the given condition, we have

$$
i + w = w.
$$

Subtracting $\vec{0}$ from both sides (noting that $\vec{0}$ acts as the additive identity), we obtain

$$
i + w + \vec{0} = w + \vec{0}.
$$

However, since $\vec{0}$ is the additive identity, it satisfies

$$
\vec{0} + v = v \quad \text{for all } v \in V.
$$

Thus, the equation simplifies to

$$
i + w = w.
$$

Given that $i + w = w$ holds for all $w \in V$, we can deduce the following by substituting $w = \vec{0}$:

$$
i + \vec{0} = \vec{0}.
$$

But since $\vec{0}$ is the additive identity,

$$
i + \vec{0} = i.
$$

Combining the two results, we obtain

$$
i = \vec{0}.
$$

Hence, the element $i$ satisfying $i + w = w$ for all $w \in V$ must be equal to the additive identity $\vec{0}$. $\textbf{Q.E.D.}$

> **Commentary**
>
> The result obtained herein is notably weaker than the corresponding assertion in Problem c, where the existence of additive inverses is assumed. In Problem c, the proof leverages the existence of additive inverses to facilitate the cancellation of terms, thereby directly establishing the equality $i = \vec{0}$ through subtraction. Specifically, the presence of additive inverses allows for the manipulation:
> 
>$$
>i + w = \vec{0} + w \implies i = \vec{0},
>$$
>
>by subtracting $w$ from both sides.
>
>In contrast, Problem e circumvents the necessity of additive inverses by employing a more restrictive approach, relying solely on the properties of the additive identity. Consequently, while both proofs culminate in the uniqueness of the additive identity, the proof in Problem e is constrained by the absence of additive inverses and thus offers a less general mechanism for establishing $i = \vec{0}$.
