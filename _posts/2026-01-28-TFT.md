## Introduction

In earlier seasons of Teamfight Tactics, the card pool could be modeled in a relatively clean way as a shared and static random resource. Champions were preloaded into a global pool, access to that pool was conditioned primarily on player level, and strategic interaction emerged almost entirely through inventory competition. Within this framework, most balance issues could be addressed locally by tuning pool sizes or appearance probabilities, without altering the structure of the system itself. The introduction of [unlockable champions](https://teamfighttactics.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/game-updates/lore-and-legends-overview/) in the current season does not fit comfortably into this model, and treating it as a conventional probability adjustment risks missing what has actually changed.

At first glance, the mechanic appears straightforward. Players satisfy certain conditions, unlock specific champions, and those champions may then appear in their shops. Framed this way, the system looks like a simple expansion of available options. However, this interpretation becomes problematic as soon as one asks a more precise question: are these champions being added to the card pool, or is access to an existing pool being selectively granted? The distinction matters. Directly injecting dozens of new champions into a shared pool would create severe dilution effects, undermine competitive symmetry, and scale poorly across future seasons. For these reasons alone, a naive “add to pool” interpretation is difficult to reconcile with a stable long-term design.

The more coherent reading, and the one adopted in this post, is that the card pool itself remains conceptually intact, while the rules governing how individual players access it have been restructured. Unlocking a champion does not primarily change what exists in the pool, but how that champion is weighted, filtered, and surfaced during shop generation for a given player. In this sense, the innovation is not a new set of cards, but a new access layer that sits between players and a shared resource. The sections that follow focus on this layer, examining how unlockable champions and recent adjustments to four- and five-cost units can be understood as consequences of a single underlying architectural choice rather than isolated balance patches.

## The Access Control Layer in System Abstraction

In the classical Teamfight Tactics model, the card pool can be abstracted as a shared finite multiset:

$$
\mathcal{C} = {(c_1, n_1), (c_2, n_2), \dots}
$$

Here, $ c_k $ denotes a specific champion, while $$ n_k $$ denotes the remaining quantity of that champion in the pool.

When a player $ i $ refreshes their shop at level $$ \ell_i $$, the operation can be described as a conditional random sampling process:

$$
\text{Shop}_i \sim \text{Sample}\big(\mathcal{C} \mid \ell_i\big)
$$

The conditioning occurs exclusively at the cost-tier level, through predefined level probability tables. Individual champions within the same cost tier are otherwise symmetric.

The essential property of this model is that all players operate within the same probability space. Differences in outcomes arise only through inventory depletion caused by other players’ purchases.
