## Introduction

[Professor Ashok Cutkosky](https://ashok.cutkosky.com/) at Boston University is teaching the renowned course [EC525: Optimization for Machine Learning (Fall 2023)](https://optmlclass.github.io/), which delves into the cutting-edge algorithms behind the optimization techniques that power modern deep learning models. I believe this course is especially valuable for anyone looking to build a deeper understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of deep learning, particularly when it comes to deriving complex formulas and mastering the sophisticated mathematical expressions often used in academic research.

One thing I really appreciate about Professor Cutkosky's approach is his awareness of how challenging proof-writing can be for many students. To address this, he has provided [a series of exercises](/assets/pdf/2023-12-02/Exercises_on_Abstract_Structures.pdf) designed specifically to help students hone their proof-writing skills. These exercises are a great way to solidify the foundational concepts that drive the optimization techniques discussed in the course.

The purpose of this blog is to follow Professor Cutkosky's course and share my own solutions and reflections on these exercises. I'll be periodically updating this blog with my answers and commentary on the problems, as I work through them and engage more deeply with the material.
