## Introduction

[Professor Ashok Cutkosky](https://ashok.cutkosky.com/) at Boston University is teaching the renowned course [EC525: Optimization for Machine Learning (Fall 2023)](https://optmlclass.github.io/), which delves into the cutting-edge algorithms behind the optimization techniques that power modern deep learning models. I believe this course is especially valuable for anyone looking to build a deeper understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of deep learning, particularly when it comes to deriving complex formulas and mastering the sophisticated mathematical expressions often used in academic research.

One thing I really appreciate about Professor Cutkosky's approach is his awareness of how challenging proof-writing can be for many students. To address this, he has provided [a series of exercises](/assets/pdf/2023-12-02/Exercises_on_Abstract_Structures.pdf) designed specifically to help students hone their proof-writing skills. These exercises are a great way to solidify the foundational concepts that drive the optimization techniques discussed in the course.

> Additionally, in these exercises, Professor Cutkosky provides several helpful suggestions and guidelines to assist with proof-writing:
>
>1. **Stick to the basics**: Focus on the definitions and axioms provided in the problem. Avoid the temptation to bring in more advanced concepts like vector space bases or singular value decompositions.
>2. **Don’t assume things are obvious**: Many statements might seem self-evident, but crafting a rigorous proof often requires more careful thought.
>3. **Use the axioms methodically**: When stuck, work through the list of axioms one by one. It's easy to overlook less commonly used ones that might be the key to the solution.
>4. **Leverage contrapositive reasoning**: Remember that the contrapositive of a statement, $A \implies B$, is logically equivalent to $\neg B \implies \neg A$. This technique can often simplify the proof process.
>
>These strategies are crucial for tackling the challenges of abstract proof-writing.

To follow Professor Cutkosky’s course and share my own solutions and reflections on these exercises, I’ve launched this blog series titled **A Commentary of the Pre-Practice for Boston University’s EC525 Course**. It is expected to include 8 posts: this preface, 6 posts with detailed commentary on each of the 6 problems, and a concluding post. I will update this series periodically, and you can click [here](https://shuhongdai.github.io/blog/category/a-review-of-the-pre-practice-for-boston-university-s-ec525-course/) to bookmark it or access it directly via the hyperlink at the end of the page.

>Notably, based on their types, I will assign appropriate titles to the blogs for each of the 6 problems to make them easier to reference.
