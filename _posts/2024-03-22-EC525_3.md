  - name: Given Conditions
  - name: （a) Show that if $L:V\to W$ and $H:W\to X$ are both linear maps, then the composition $H\circ L:V\to X$ is a linear map.
  - name: '(b) Show $\vec{0}_v$that if $L: V \to W$ is a linear map, then $L(\vec{0}_{V}) = \vec{0}_{W}$, where $\vec{0}_{V}$ indicates the additive identity in $V$ and $\vec{0}_{W}$ indicates the additive identity in $W$.'
  - name: (c) The kernel of a linear map $L:V\to W$ is the set of points $v\in V$ such that $L(v)=\vec{0}_{W}$. Show that a linear map $L:V\to W$ is 1-1 if and only if the kernel of $L$ consists of only the identity element $\vec{0}_{V}$.
  - name: '(d) A *subspace* of a vector space $V$ is a subset $S \subset V$ such that for all $v, w \in S$, $v + w \in S$ and for all $v \in S$ and $c \in \mathbb{R}$, $c \cdot v \in S$. That is, the subspace is *closed* under the addition and scalar multiplication operations. Show that the kernel of a linear map $L: V \to W$ forms a subspace of the space $V$.'
  - name: (e) Show that the image of a linear map $L:V\to W$ is a subspace of $W$.
  - name: '(f) The set of linear maps from $V$ to $W$ is typically denoted $\mathcal{L}(V,W)$. Define an addition operation on linear maps as follows: given $F,G\in\mathcal{L}(V,W)$, set $K=F+G$ by $K(v)=F(v)+G(v)$, where the addition on the RHS here is the addition operation in $W$. Similarly, given $c\in\mathbb{R}$, we define a scalar multiplication $K=c\cdot F$ by $K(v)=c\cdot F(v)$, where again the scalar multiplication is the operation in $W$. Show that with these operations, $\mathcal{L}(V,W)$ is a vector space.'
