## Given Conditions

A group is a set $G$ together with a binary operation $\circ$. The binary operation $\circ$ takes two elements of $G$, and returns an element of $G$. We write $x \circ y$ to indicate the returned value of $\circ$ on input $x$ and $y$. Note that the ordering is important: $x \circ y$ might not be equal to $y \circ x$. If you like, you can instead think of a function $b : G \times G \rightarrow G$ where $x \circ y$ is just shorthand for $b(x,y)$. The binary operation must satisfy:
- $(x \circ y) \circ z = x \circ (y \circ z)$ for all $x, y, z \in G$.
- There must be some element $i \in G$ such that $x \circ i = i \circ x = x$ for all $x \in G$.
- For each $x \in G$, there is an element $x^{-1}$ called the inverse of $x$ such that $x \circ x^{-1} = x^{-1} \circ x = i$.

## (a) Consider a set $G$ with two elements $a$ and $b$. Provide a binary operation $\circ$ that turns $G$into a group.

**Proposition 3.a.1.** _Let $G = \{a, b\}$. Define a binary operation $\circ : G \times G \to G$ by prescribing the following values:_  

$$
a \circ a = a, \quad a \circ b = b, \quad b \circ a = b, \quad b \circ b = a.
$$  

_Then the algebraic structure $(G, \circ)$ is a group._

*Proof.* Consider the set $G = \{a, b\}$ and the operation $\circ : G \times G \to G$ defined by  

$$
\forall x,y \in G: x \circ y = 
\begin{cases}
a, & \text{if } (x,y) = (a,a) \text{ or } (b,b), \\[6pt]
b, & \text{if } (x,y) = (a,b) \text{ or } (b,a).
\end{cases}
$$

Closure: By construction of the operation $\circ$, for each ordered pair $(x,y) \in G \times G$, the element $ x \circ y $ is defined to be either $ a $ or $ b $, both of which lie in $ G $. Hence:

   $$
   \forall x,y \in G: x \circ y \in G.
   $$

Associativity:  To establish that $\circ$ is associative, it suffices to verify that for all $ x,y,z \in G $, the equality

   $$
   (x \circ y) \circ z = x \circ (y \circ z)
   $$
   
 holds. Since $\vert G \vert =2$, one must verify all possible combinations of $(x,y,z)$. The tuples in $G \times G \times G$ are $(a,a,a), (a,a,b), (a,b,a), (a,b,b), (b,a,a), (b,a,b), (b,b,a), (b,b,b)$.

   Consider each case in turn:

   - For $(x,y,z) = (a,a,a)$:

     $$
     (a \circ a) \circ a = a \circ a = a, \quad a \circ (a \circ a) = a \circ a = a.
     $$

   - For $(x,y,z) = (a,a,b)$:

     $$
     (a \circ a) \circ b = a \circ b = b, \quad a \circ (a \circ b) = a \circ b = b.
     $$

   - For $(x,y,z) = (a,b,a)$:

     $$
     (a \circ b) \circ a = b \circ a = b, \quad a \circ (b \circ a) = a \circ b = b.
     $$

   - For $(x,y,z) = (a,b,b)$:

     $$
     (a \circ b) \circ b = b \circ b = a, \quad a \circ (b \circ b) = a \circ a = a.
     $$

   - For $(x,y,z) = (b,a,a)$:

     $$
     (b \circ a) \circ a = b \circ a = b, \quad b \circ (a \circ a) = b \circ a = b.
     $$

   - For $(x,y,z) = (b,a,b)$:

     $$
     (b \circ a) \circ b = b \circ b = a, \quad b \circ (a \circ b) = b \circ b = a.
     $$

   - For $(x,y,z) = (b,b,a)$:

     $$
     (b \circ b) \circ a = a \circ a = a, \quad b \circ (b \circ a) = b \circ b = a.
     $$

   - For $(x,y,z) = (b,b,b)$:

     $$
     (b \circ b) \circ b = a \circ b = b, \quad b \circ (b \circ b) = b \circ a = b.
     $$

   In each of these eight cases, the left-hand side $(x \circ y) \circ z$ equals the right-hand side $x \circ (y \circ z)$. Therefore, associativity holds:

   $$
   \forall x,y,z \in G: (x \circ y) \circ z = x \circ (y \circ z).
   $$

Existence of an Identity Element: An identity element $ i \in G $ must satisfy

   $$
   \forall x \in G: x \circ i = x \quad \text{and} \quad i \circ x = x.
   $$
   
   By inspection of the defining relations of $\circ$, the element $ a $ behaves as an identity:
   
   $$
   a \circ a = a, \quad a \circ b = b, \quad b \circ a = b.
   $$
   
   Hence:
   
   $$
   \forall x \in G: x \circ a = x \quad \text{and} \quad a \circ x = x.
   $$
   
   Thus, $ a $ serves as the identity element $ i $ of $(G, \circ)$.

Existence of Inverses: For each $ x \in G $, an inverse $ x^{-1} \in G $ must satisfy
   
   $$
   x \circ x^{-1} = i \quad \text{and} \quad x^{-1} \circ x = i.
   $$
   
   Since the identity element $ i = a $ has been identified, one must determine inverses with respect to $ a $:

   - For $ x = a $:

     $$
     a \circ a = a = i, \quad a \circ a = i.
     $$

     Thus, $ a^{-1} = a $.

   - For $ x = b $:

     $$
     b \circ b = a = i, \quad b \circ b = i.
     $$

     Thus, $ b^{-1} = b $.

   Therefore:

   $$
   a^{-1} = a, \quad b^{-1} = b.
   $$

Since all four group axioms—closure, associativity, existence of an identity, and existence of inverses—have been rigorously verified, it follows that $(G, \circ)$ is indeed a group. $\textbf{Q.E.D.}$

>**Commentary**

>The constructed group $(G,\circ)$ is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, often denoted by $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, under addition modulo 2.

## (b) Construct set $G$ of size 4 and binary operation $\circ$ such that $G$ forms a group and every element of $G$ satisfies $x\circ x=i$.

**Proposition 3.b.1.** *Let $G = \{ i, a, b, c \}$ be a set of four distinct elements, and define a binary operation $\circ : G \times G \to G$ by prescribing the following properties:*

$$
i \circ i = i, \quad a \circ a = i, \quad b \circ b = i, \quad c \circ c = i,
$$

_and_

$$
a \circ b = c, \quad b \circ a = c, \quad b \circ c = a, \quad c \circ b = a, \quad c \circ a = b, \quad a \circ c = b.
$$

_Furthermore, for every $x \in G$,_

$$
i \circ x = x \quad \text{and} \quad x \circ i = x.
$$

*Then $(G, \circ)$ is a group of order 4, and each of its elements satisfies the property $x \circ x = i$.*

*Proof.* Define $G = \{i, a, b, c\}$ and the operation $\circ : G \times G \rightarrow G$ by the Cayley table:

$$
\begin{array}{c|cccc}
\circ & i & a & b & c \\ \hline
i & i & a & b & c \\
a & a & i & c & b \\
b & b & c & i & a \\
c & c & b & a & i
\end{array}
$$

Closure:  By inspection of the table, for all $x, y \in G$, the element $x \circ y$ is always one of $i, a, b, c$. Thus:

   $$
   \forall x,y \in G:\; x \circ y \in G.
   $$

Associativity: To demonstrate associativity, it suffices to verify that for all $x,y,z \in G$,

   $$
   (x \circ y) \circ z = x \circ (y \circ z).
   $$
   
   Since $\vert G \vert =4$, a direct verification can be conducted by enumerating all triplets $(x,y,z)$. Each computation conforms to the pattern of a direct product of two-element groups or can be seen to follow from the algebraic structure of the Klein four-group, commonly denoted by $V_4$ or $C_2 \times C_2$, which is known to be associative.

   Notably, the structure defined by these rules is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, which is well known in group theory to be associative. Hence, no contradictions arise, ensuring:
   
   $$
   \forall x,y,z \in G:\; (x \circ y) \circ z = x \circ (y \circ z).
   $$

Identity Element: By examination of the table, the element $i$ serves as an identity, since:

   $$
   \forall x \in G:\; x \circ i = x \quad \text{and} \quad i \circ x = x.
   $$
   
 Thus $i$ is the identity element of the group $(G,\circ)$.

Inverses: Each element is its own inverse. By construction:

   $$
   a \circ a = i, \quad b \circ b = i, \quad c \circ c = i, \quad i \circ i = i.
   $$
   
Therefore, $a^{-1} = a$, $b^{-1} = b$, $c^{-1} = c$, and $i^{-1} = i$.

Since all group axioms—closure, associativity, identity, and inverses—are satisfied, $(G,\circ)$ is a group. $\textbf{Q.E.D.}$

>**Commentary**
>
>The structure $(G,\circ)$ thus obtained is known as the Klein four-group, and it is a classic example of a group in which every element is of order 2, except the identity.

## \(c\) Construct a set $G$ of size 4 and a function $b$ such that $G$ forms a group and there exists an element of $G$ that does not satisfy $x\circ x=i$.

**Proposition 3.c.1.** *Let $G = \{0,1,2,3\}$ and define a binary operation $\circ : G \times G \to G$ by*  

$$
x \circ y = (x + y) \mod 4,
$$

*for all $x,y \in G$, where $+$ denotes the usual addition of integers and $\mod 4$ denotes the remainder upon division by 4. Then $(G, \circ)$ is a group, and there exists an element $x \in G$ such that $x \circ x \neq i$, where $i$ is the identity element.*


*Proof.* Consider the set $G = \{0,1,2,3\}$. Define the binary operation $\circ : G \times G \to G$ by the rule

$$
x \circ y = (x + y) \bmod 4.
$$

Closure: Since $x,y \in \{0,1,2,3\}$, the integer sum $x + y$ is an integer between 0 and 6. Taking this sum modulo 4 yields an element in $\{0,1,2,3\}$. Thus:

   $$
   \forall x,y \in G, \quad x \circ y \in G.
   $$

Associativity: For any $x,y,z \in G$, we must verify

   $$
   (x \circ y) \circ z = x \circ (y \circ z).
   $$
   
   By definition:
   
   $$
   (x \circ y) \circ z = ((x + y) \bmod 4 + z) \bmod 4,
   $$
   
   $$
   x \circ (y \circ z) = (x + (y + z) \bmod 4) \bmod 4.
   $$
   
   Since addition modulo 4 is associative, it follows that:
   
   $$
   ((x + y) + z) \bmod 4 = (x + (y + z)) \bmod 4.
   $$
   
   Therefore, associativity holds:
   
   $$
   \forall x,y,z \in G, \; (x \circ y) \circ z = x \circ (y \circ z).
   $$

Identity Element: An identity element $i \in G$ must satisfy

   $$
   \forall x \in G, \; x \circ i = x \quad \text{and} \quad i \circ x = x.
   $$
   
   By inspection, when choosing $i = 0$:
   
   $$
   x \circ 0 = (x + 0) \bmod 4 = x,
   $$
   
   $$
   0 \circ x = (0 + x) \bmod 4 = x.
   $$
   
   Thus, $i = 0$ is the identity element of $(G,\circ)$.

Inverses:  For each $x \in G$, we must find $x^{-1} \in G$ such that

   $$
   x \circ x^{-1} = 0, \quad x^{-1} \circ x = 0,
   $$
   
   where $0$ is the identity. Since addition modulo 4 forms a cyclic group, each element is invertible:
   
   - For $x = 0$:

     $$
     0 + 0 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}, \text{ so } 0^{-1} = 0.
     $$
     
   - For $x = 1$:

     $$
     1 + 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}, \text{ so } 1^{-1} = 3.
     $$
     
   - For $x = 2$:

     $$
     2 + 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}, \text{ so } 2^{-1} = 2.
     $$
     
   - For $x = 3$:

     $$
     3 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}, \text{ so } 3^{-1} = 1.
     $$

   Hence, every element has an inverse.

Since $(G, \circ)$ satisfies closure, associativity, has an identity element, and each element has an inverse, it follows that $(G, \circ)$ is a group.

Consider $x = 1$. Then:

$$
1 \circ 1 = (1 + 1) \bmod 4 = 2.
$$

Note that $i = 0$, thus:

$$
1 \circ 1 = 2 \neq 0.
$$

Thus, there exists an element in $G$, namely $x = 1$, for which $x \circ x \neq i$. In fact, in this group, only the element $2$ satisfies $x \circ x = i$, whereas $1$ and $3$ do not. $\textbf{Q.E.D.}$

>**Commentary**
>
> This confirms the existence of a group of order 4 in which not every element is an involution.

## (d) Show that if $x\circ y=x\circ z$, then $y=z$.

**Proposition 3.d.1.** *Let $(G,\circ)$ be a group with identity element $i$. Suppose $x,y,z \in G$ and assume that*

$$
x \circ y = x \circ z.
$$

*Then $y = z$.*

*Proof.* Since $(G,\circ)$ is a group, each element $x \in G$ has an inverse $x^{-1} \in G$ such that

$$
x^{-1} \circ x = x \circ x^{-1} = i,
$$

where $i$ is the identity element of $G$.

Given the equation

$$
x \circ y = x \circ z,
$$

apply the inverse $x^{-1}$ to the left of both sides:

$$
x^{-1} \circ (x \circ y) = x^{-1} \circ (x \circ z).
$$

By associativity of the group operation $\circ$, we have:

$$
(x^{-1} \circ x) \circ y = (x^{-1} \circ x) \circ z.
$$

Since $x^{-1} \circ x = i$, it follows that:

$$
i \circ y = i \circ z.
$$

By the defining property of the identity element $i$:

$$
y = z.
$$

This completes the proof, showing that left-cancellation holds in a group. $\textbf{Q.E.D.}$
